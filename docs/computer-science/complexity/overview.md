# Complexity Overview
Complexity is a measure of how effecient an algorithm is in relation to the size of its input. We are concerned about two types of complexity: time and space.

## Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measure of *how long an algorithm takes to run* in relation to the size of its input.

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is a measure of *how much memory an algorithm uses* in relation to the size of its input.

## Big Notation
Big notation is a way to describe the complexity of an algorithm. It is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of its input grows.

It is not an exact measure of how long an algorithm will take to run, but it is a good way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms as they scale.

There are three types of Big Notation:

- Big O
    - Upper bound - worst case
- Big Theta
    - Tight bound - average case
- Big Omega
    - Lower bound - best case
