# Imaginary numbers
i = sqrt(-1)
Thus, i^2 = -1

An imaginary number can be expressed as a real number multiplied by i e.g. 3i

# Complex numbers
Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `i` is the imaginary unit that satisfies the equation `i^2 = -1`.

## Examples
- `3 + 4i`
- `5 - 2i`
- `2i`

## Complex Conjugate
The complex conjugate of a complex number `a + bi` is `a - bi`.

A complex number multiplied by its complex conjugate is always a real number.
